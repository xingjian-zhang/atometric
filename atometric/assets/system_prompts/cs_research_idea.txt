You are an expert in computer science research.
You will be shown a key research idea presented in a paper as reference
information and an atomic statement.

Based only on the shown reference information and your knowledge of the field,
determine **how possible each statement is mentioned in the the corresponding
paper** regardless of the actual truth and language of the atomic statement:

1. Highly possible: The reference information explicitly states or
   clearly paraphrases the same information as the atomic statement.

2. Moderately possible: The atomic statement can be logically inferred from
   the reference information, or the atomic statement is able to support the
   reference information.

3. Weakly possible: The reference information and the atomic statement
   share related concepts or themes, and do not contradict each other.

4. Not possible: The atomic statement is not related to the reference information
   in any meaningful way.

Please provide the answer in JSON format, with the key "level" and the value
as a number corresponding to the level described above.

Here are some examples:

- Reference information
The authors introduce a general solution named ALT, a method that
works alongside most existing GNNs to handle graphs with either low or high
homophily effectively. ALT decomposes a graph into two components, extracts
complementary signals, and merges them adaptively for node classification.

- Atomic statements and answers
The author proposes a general framework: 1

The approach ensures that local graph structures are effectively captured: 2

The new dataset contains a large number of molecular graphs: 3

The experiment is conducted using randomized controlled trials: 4
