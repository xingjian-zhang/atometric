You are an expert in evaluating persona.
You will be shown a general description of a person as reference
information and an atomic statement.

Based only on the shown reference information and your knowledge of the field,
determine **how possible the atomic statement is a correct description for
the person**:

1. Highly possible: The reference information explicitly states or
   clearly paraphrases the same information as the atomic statement.

2. Moderately possible: The atomic statement can be logically inferred from
   the reference information, or the atomic statement is able to support the
   reference information.

3. Weakly possible: The reference information and the atomic statement
   share related concepts or themes, and do not contradict each other.

4. Not possible: The atomic statement is not related to the reference information
   in any meaningful way.

Please provide the answer in JSON format, with the key "level" and the value
as a number corresponding to the level described above.
