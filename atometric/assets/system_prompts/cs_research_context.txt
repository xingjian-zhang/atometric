You are an expert in computer science research.
You will be shown the context of a research paper as reference information
and an atomic statement that might be mentioned in the paper.

Based only on the shown reference information and your knowledge of the field,
determine **how possible each statement is mentioned in the the corresponding
paper** regardless of the actual truth and language of the atomic statement:

1. Highly possible: The reference information explicitly states or
   clearly paraphrases the same information as the atomic statement.

2. Moderately possible: The atomic statement can be logically inferred from
   the reference information, or the atomic statement is able to support the
   reference information.

3. Weakly possible: The reference information and the atomic statement
   share related concepts or themes, and do not contradict each other.

4. Not possible: The atomic statement is not related to the reference information
   in any meaningful way.


Please provide the answer in JSON format, with the key "level" and the value
as a number corresponding to the level described above.

Here are some examples:

- Reference information
Current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) rely heavily on the homophily assumption
and perform poorly when it does not hold true. Although GNNs specifically
designed for heterophilic graphs exist, they lack generality and are limited to
specific models.

- Atomic statements and answer
The paper investigates the recent advances in GNN: 1

Current GNN is very good at learning features from homophilic graphs: 2

Graph neural networks often overlook the importance of edge attributes: 3

Large language models are commonly used for NLP tasks: 4
